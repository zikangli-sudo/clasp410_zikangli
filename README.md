This repository is my personal GitHub workspace for CLIMATE 410, a course on Earth System Modeling that focuses on building, testing, and applying numerical models of the Earth system. The class explores numerical solvers, probabilistic methods, and physics-based approaches in Python, with an emphasis on code design, testing, documentation, and version control using Git. Here I will be uploading my homework assignments, lab projects, and final project, which include implementations of 2D advective flow simulations, tests of numerical diffusion, and other models developed throughout the semester. The repository is organized to keep code, data, and documentation structured and reproducible, serving both as a record of my progress in the course and as a portfolio of my work in scientific computing and Earth system modeling.
